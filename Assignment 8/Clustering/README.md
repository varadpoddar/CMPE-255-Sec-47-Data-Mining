# Assignment 8 — Clustering (Colab-first)

One Colab per component. Run each in Colab (GPU/TPU if needed), capture outputs, and record a short walkthrough video. Links below are for reference only; do not commit datasets/checkpoints.

## Components (to be delivered)
1) K-Means clustering **from scratch** (completed template: `colabs/kmeans_from_scratch.ipynb`)
2) Hierarchical clustering (library-based)
3) Gaussian mixture models (GMM) clustering
4) DBSCAN clustering (PyCaret)
5) Anomaly detection with PyOD (uni/multivariate)
6) Time-series clustering with pretrained models
7) Document clustering with LLM embeddings
8) Image clustering with ImageBind/LLM embeddings
9) Audio clustering with ImageBind/LLM embeddings

## How to use the Colabs
- Open the notebook in Colab, select GPU runtime if needed.
- Install requirements inside the notebook (pinned where provided).
- Run all cells; ensure charts/tables render. Add screenshots/links to your walkthrough video in the notebook.
- Export executed notebook (with outputs) back to this folder.

## Status
- K-Means from scratch: template ready (with inline documentation, visualization, metrics). Needs execution in Colab and video capture.
- Remaining components: stubs pending; follow the list above to add one notebook per item.
