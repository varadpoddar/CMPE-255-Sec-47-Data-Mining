# AutoGluon Segmentation / Document-PDF Classification — not executed

- Intended tasks: semantic segmentation quick-start, document and PDF classification tutorials.
- Status: Not executed in the current `.venv` to avoid kernel instability from large CV models on CPU-only Mac (previous timeseries install caused crashes).
- How to run later: use tiny image/doc samples, follow the official notebooks (`beginner_semantic_seg.ipynb`, document/pdf classification demos), keep `time_limit` low, and ensure adequate GPU if possible.
