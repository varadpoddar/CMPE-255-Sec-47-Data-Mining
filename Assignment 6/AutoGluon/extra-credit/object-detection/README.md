# AutoGluon Object Detection — not executed

- Intended task: run the COCO quick-start object detection tutorial on a minimal sample.
- Status: Not executed in the current `.venv`; heavy vision models plus prior kernel crashes (timeseries) make this risky on CPU-only Mac.
- How to run later (suggested): use a very small COCO-style subset (e.g., 2–3 images) and follow `quick_start_coco.ipynb` with `time_limit` capped; expect longer runtimes without GPU.
