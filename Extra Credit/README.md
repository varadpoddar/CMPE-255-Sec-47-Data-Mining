# Extra Credit

Two extra credit mini-assignments to be delivered as Colab notebooks (run-through videos recommended):

1) **Derek Banas Python tutorial** — end-to-end Python language tour. Notebook: `derek_banas_python.ipynb` (created and runnable locally/Colab). Covers syntax, collections, control flow, functions, decorators, classes, file IO, regex, etc. Add your own embellishments as you watch the tutorial.
2) **Pandas + NumPy advanced walk-through** — pick a small Kaggle dataset (e.g., Titanic or California Housing), build a rich notebook with indexing, reshaping, joins/merges, groupby/agg, window ops, plotting, vectorized NumPy ops/broadcasting, and performance tips. Save executed notebook in this folder.

Guidelines
- Use GPU/TPU only if needed; CPU is fine for these.
- Keep datasets small (<50MB). Download inside the notebook via Kaggle API or public HTTP link; do not commit data files.
- Export executed notebooks (with outputs) and link any walkthrough videos in the notebook header.
